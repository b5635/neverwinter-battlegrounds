************************* [On Death] *******************************************
    Speeded up no end, when compiling, with seperate Include.
    Cleans up all un-droppable items, all ints and all local things when destroyed.

    Check down near the bottom for a good place to add XP or corpse lines ;-)
************************* [History] ********************************************
    1.3 - Added in Turn of corpses toggle
        - Added in appropriate space for XP awards, marked with ideas (effect death)
************************* [Workings] *******************************************
    You can edit this for experience, there is a seperate section for it.

    It will use DeathCheck to execute a cleanup-and-destroy script, that removes
    any coprse, named "j_ai_destroyself".
************************* [Arguments] ******************************************
    Arguments: GetLastKiller.

    THIS is the place for it, below this comment. To reward XP, you might want
    to first apply EffectDeath to ourselves (uncomment the example lines) which
    will remove the "You recieved 0 Experience" if you have normal XP at 0, as
    the On Death event is before the reward, and therefore now our last killer
    will be outselves. It will not cause any errors, oKiller is already set.

    Anything else, I leave to you. GetFirstFactionMember (and next), GiveXPToCreature,
    GetXP, SetXP, GetChallengeRating all are really useful.

    Bug note: GetFirstFactionMember/Next with the PC parameter means either ONLY PC
